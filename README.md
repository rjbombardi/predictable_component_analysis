The funtions "laplacians.py" calculates Laplacian eigenfunctions, which represnt an orthogonal basis set that is ordered by
length scale. For instance, Fourier series used to decompose time series are a special case of Laplacian eigenvectors.
Eigenvectors of the Laplace operator are used to identify spatial patterns that are orthogonal with respect to an area-weighted
inner product. Analogously to time series decomposition, these spatial patterns represent the decomposition of the domain by
length scale.
